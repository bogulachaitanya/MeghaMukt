# MeghaMukt: AI-Powered Satellite Cloud Reconstruction Platform

![MeghaMukt Platform](docs/images/hero.png)

**PS-2 Ã¢â‚¬â€ Generative AI-Based Cloud Removal and Reconstruction for LISS-IV Satellite Imagery**

*   **Live Demo:** [https://meghamukt.vercel.app/](https://meghamukt.vercel.app/)
*   **Presentation PDF:** [Bah Hackathon.pdf](docs/Bah_Hackathon.pdf)

MeghaMukt is an advanced AI-powered web platform developed for intelligent cloud detection and cloud-free satellite image reconstruction. Built for the Bharatiya Antariksh Hackathon, the system combines deep learning, modern web technologies, and an interactive mission-control dashboard to transform cloud-obstructed satellite imagery into analysis-ready scenes.

The platform provides an end-to-end workflowÃ¢â‚¬â€from uploading Sentinel-2 imagery to cloud detection, AI reconstruction, visualization, model evaluation, and performance monitoringÃ¢â‚¬â€all through a futuristic, space-inspired user interface.

## Objective

MeghaMukt aims to reconstruct cloud-obscured satellite imagery while preserving spatial structures and spectral characteristics, enabling researchers, disaster management teams, agricultural analysts, and environmental scientists to obtain high-quality cloud-free imagery for accurate geospatial analysis.

## Landing Experience

![Landing Experience](docs/images/landing.png)

The homepage is designed as an immersive space mission experience featuring an interactive 3D Earth visualization. Users are guided through the complete satellite reconstruction pipeline with cinematic animations explaining:
* The challenge of cloud-covered satellite imagery
* AI-based cloud detection
* Neural reconstruction using deep learning
* Generation of cloud-free analysis-ready images
* Real-time mission completion statistics

The landing page introduces the project with a modern space-themed interface that reflects real satellite mission control systems.

## AI Reconstruction Dashboard

![AI Reconstruction Dashboard](docs/images/reconstruction_dashboard.png)


The dashboard serves as the operational center of the application.
Users can:
* Upload Sentinel-2 satellite imagery
* Automatically detect cloud-covered regions
* Generate cloud masks
* Perform AI-based cloud reconstruction
* Compare reconstructed imagery against ground truth
* View inference results in real time

The dashboard presents four synchronized visualization panels:
1. Cloudy Satellite Image
2. Cloud Mask
3. AI Reconstructed Image
4. Ground Truth Reference

This side-by-side comparison allows users to visually inspect reconstruction quality.

## Analytics Dashboard

![Analytics Dashboard](docs/images/analytics_dashboard.png)

The Analytics section provides a comprehensive overview of reconstruction performance through interactive visualizations. It includes:
* Total processed scenes
* Average cloud coverage
* Reconstruction quality score
* Average inference time
* Cloud coverage trends
* Terrain analysis
* Cloud class distribution
* Quality metric summaries
* Processing statistics

The interface enables quick monitoring of overall system performance.

## Data Layers & Spectral Analysis

![Data Layers and Spectral Analysis](docs/images/spectral_analysis.png)

The platform exposes multiple diagnostic data layers for satellite image analysis.
Available layers include:
* True Color Image
* Cloud Mask
* Difference Map
* Confidence Map
* Cloudy Original
* Blended Reconstruction

Additional scientific visualizations include:
* Spectral response curves
* Multi-band quality analysis
* Pixel histograms
* Band-wise accuracy indicators
* Sentinel-2 band information

These tools help evaluate reconstruction quality beyond simple visual inspection.

## AI Model Performance Monitoring

![Model Performance](docs/images/model_performance.png)

The application includes a dedicated page for monitoring deep learning model performance. Displayed information includes:
* Model architecture
* Best training epoch
* Validation loss
* Model size
* Saved checkpoints
* Training progress
* Optimizer configuration
* Input/output channels
* Dataset information
* Device configuration

This enables continuous monitoring of the training process and model evolution.

## AI Reconstruction Pipeline

The system follows a complete AI processing workflow:
1. Satellite Image Upload
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Cloud Detection
4. Binary Cloud Mask Generation
5. AI-Based Cloud Reconstruction
6. Post-Processing & Image Fusion
7. Quality Assessment
8. Final Cloud-Free Output Generation

Each processing stage is visualized within the dashboard, providing transparency throughout the reconstruction process.
